WISHFUL:

1. Keyboard Shortcuts Enhancement
    a. CTRL+1, CTRL+2, etc for tagging, plus the ability to assign spacebar to one specific tag of the user's choosing
2. Save and loading project (saving which and what items were tagged)
    a. Also an autosave every five feature to a temp folder that can be recovered if program unexpectably closes/crashes/power loss
    b. This save feature should be an archive of not only the conversation, but also of any/all the custom tags, what messages have tags, etc
3. Sentiment analysis and summary
    a. Needs to be done LOCALLY. Should be an opt-in setting. Give warning if user has <4GB VRAM
    b. Use a super tiny AI model? Use NLTK?
4. HTML exporting
