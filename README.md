# Message Maestro

Message Maestro is a modern, GPU-accelerated desktop application for viewing, tagging, and exporting conversations from various messaging platforms. It features a beautiful, responsive UI built with PyQt6, advanced message parsing, customizable tagging, and high-quality PDF export. The application is designed for both casual users and professionals who need to analyze, archive, or present chat data.

- **Media & Link Detection:**
  - Messages with media or links are automatically highlighted.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
  - Efficient navigation and tagging with keyboard shortcuts (see TODO for planned enhancements).
- **Extensible Architecture:**
  - Easily add new message parsers for other platforms by implementing the `BaseParser` interface.

## Search Bars Explained

Message Maestro features two powerful and distinct search bars to help you quickly find conversations and messages:

### 1. Global Conversation Search (Sidebar Search Bar)

- **Location:** At the top of the left sidebar, always visible.
- **Purpose:** Search across all loaded conversations for keywords in conversation titles, participant names, or message content.
- **How it works:**
  - Type a keyword or phrase and press Enter (or click the search icon).
  - Results instantly filter the conversation list below, showing only conversations that match your search.
  - You can refine your search using radio buttons:
    - **All:** Search both conversation titles and message content.
    - **Titles:** Only search conversation titles and participant names.
    - **Content:** Only search within the text of messages.
  - Click the clear (‚úï) button to reset the search and show all conversations again.
- **Use case:** Quickly locate a conversation by a participant's name, group title, or a word/phrase mentioned anywhere in the chat history.

### 2. In-Conversation Search (Header Search Bar)

- **Location:** At the top of the main chat view, appears after you open a conversation and click the 'üîç Search' button in the header.
- **Purpose:** Search for specific words or phrases within the currently open conversation.
- **How it works:**
  - Type your search term and press Enter.
  - All matching messages are highlighted in the chat view.
  - Use the **Next ‚Üì** and **‚Üë Prev** buttons to jump between matches.
  - The search bar displays the number of matches and your current position (e.g., "3 of 7").
  - Click the close (‚úï) button to exit in-conversation search and clear highlights.
- **Use case:** Find every instance of a word, phrase, or name within a single conversation, and quickly navigate between them for review or tagging.

**Tip:** The two search bars are independent; use the sidebar search to find the right conversation, then use the in-conversation search to drill down to the exact messages you need.
